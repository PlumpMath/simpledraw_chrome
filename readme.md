# SimpleDraw

A Chrome Packaged Application for Chrome OS or any system running the Chrome browser.

SimpleDraw is a no frills drawing application for sketching out ideas. It’s not a program for creating art. You won’t find any fancy filters, shapes, stickers, etc. It was originally developed as a tool for creating educational videos, where I have the need to illustrate certain concepts in physics or math. It’s most like a blackboard (or whiteboard). You can set the width and color of the line you’re drawing and there are a few tools to help you draw straight lines. You can also erase, undo/redo and set the background color.

A key feature of the program is that you can go full screen and hide the toolbar and almost all features of the program are accessible through keyboard shortcuts. So if you’re making a video or doing a presentation, there’s no need to jump in and out of the user interface to change colors or line width, erase, undo, redo, clear the screen, etc.
